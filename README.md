# Project ACS
# This project is aimed at facilitating the control of the access regime, in other words, it is a ACS. This project will be completed and will not be supported in the future due to its imperfection, the platform's irrelevance, the multiple availability of the same product that works better and has more advantages compared to this. Simply put, this is a pen test.
